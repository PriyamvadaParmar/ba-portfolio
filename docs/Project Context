# 01 — Project Context
Engagement for a mid-sized digital bank to enhance mobile and online banking.
Goals: identify operational inefficiencies, propose digital feature upgrades, and oversee delivery to improve customer experience and operational efficiency.

**Key pain points**

- Slow logins and frequent session timeouts
- Transfer/loan flow drop-offs
- High volume of support tickets for basic queries
